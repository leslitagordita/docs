## Features

### Secure and Private Communication

Create a private L2 network and attach your Linode's to it for secure and private communication in the cloud. Two or more Linodes connected via the Private LAN can see each other as if they were directly connected to the same physical Ethernet network. Devices outside of the network cannot see any traffic within the private network.

### Simple Configuration

Use the Beta Cloud Manager to create a Virtual LAN and attach Linode's to it in just a few clicks. Create up to 10 Virtual LANs per data center, and apply up to 3 Virtual LANs to a single Linode. For more fine-grained control, use the Linode APIv4 or Linode CLI.

### Reduce Network Transfer Costs

Private network transfer is free. Any communication between Linodes over the private Virtual LAN does not count against your monthly [network transfer quota](/docs/guides/network-transfer-quota/).

## Limitations

* A Linode can only be attached to a Virtual LAN that resides within the same data center region as the Linode.

    If you attempt to migrate a Linode to a data center region that does not support Virtual LANs and the Linode is attached to a Virtual LAN, the Linode is automatically detached from the Virutal LAN and it no longer has access to the private network.

## Pricing

Virtual LANs are free to use. Communication across your private network does not count against your monthly [network transfer quota](/docs/guides/network-transfer-quota/).
