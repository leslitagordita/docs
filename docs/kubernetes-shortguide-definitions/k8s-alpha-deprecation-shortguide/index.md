{{< caution >}}
The [k8s-alpha CLI](/docs/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-kubernetes-on-linode-with-k8s-alpha-cli/) is deprecated. On **March 31st, 2020**, it will be **removed** from the [linode-cli](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli). After March 31, 2020, you will no longer be able to create or manage clusters created by the k8s-alpha CLI plugin.

However, you will still be able to successfully manage your clusters using [Terraform](/docs/applications/configuration-management/beginners-guide-to-terraform/), which is how the k8s-alpha CLI itself is implemented. The Terraform configuration files that the k8s-alpha CLI creates are stored in your computer's home folder, under the `.k8s-alpha-linode/` directory.

Other alternatives for creating and managing clusters include:

- The [Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)](/docs/kubernetes/deploy-and-manage-a-cluster-with-linode-kubernetes-engine-a-tutorial/), which creates clusters managed by Linode.
- [Rancher](/docs/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-kubernetes-on-linode-with-rancher-2-x/), which provides a graphical user interface for managing clusters.
