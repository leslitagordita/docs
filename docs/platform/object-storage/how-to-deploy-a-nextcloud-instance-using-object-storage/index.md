[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is an open source solution to file hosting and sharing. With Nextcloud, you can synchronize files from your local computer to your Linode server and share them with your collaborators. Nextcloudâ€™s customizable security features and intuitive user interface help keep your files safe and easy to manage.

You can configure Nextcloud to enable external storage services, like [Linode Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/), to use as a secondary place to keep your files. Using an Linode Object Storage to store your files will prevent you from running out of storage space limited by your Linode's plan size. When using Nextcloud's graphical user interface (GUI) to manage your files, your external storage device will show up just like any other folder.

## Before You Begin

1. Deploy a Nextcloud server instance. You can use the Linode Nextcloud One-Click App for an easy and quick deployment.

1. [Enable Linode Object Storage on your account](/docs/platform/object-storage/how-to-use-object-storage/#enable-object-storage).

1. [Generate Object Storage access keys](/docs/platform/object-storage/how-to-use-object-storage/#generate-a-key-pair).
